# Signal_FFT_GUI
A Python GUI generated with PyQt5 Designer to calculate and show the FFT of time series (separated by a tabulator {\t}. 
A low pass filter can also be applied on the series. An input field allows the user to input the value of the cutoff frequency of the filter.

## Start the GUI
- Download the code
- Double click on the main.py file to start the GUI. 

## Load data
- With the load botton you can load the time series. 
- Select the file and click open (or double click the file) and it will be loaded automatically.<br />
Two test files with two different time series are included.

## FFT
- With the FFT botton you can show the FFT of the time series

## Low Pass filter
- User can select either first "1st" or second "2nd" order filter and input the cut-off frequeny of the filter
- With the " Apply Filter " botton, the Graphs will be updated showing in a different colors the filtered signal and its corresponding FFT
